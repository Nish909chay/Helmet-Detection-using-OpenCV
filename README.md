# Helmet-Detection-using-OpenCV
The Helmet Detection System is an innovative project aimed at enhancing road safety through the automated detection of helmet compliance among motorcyclists. The system is developed using the Python programming language, leveraging the OpenCV library for image processing and the YOLO v8 (You Only Look Once) framework for real-time object detection.
